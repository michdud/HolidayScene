# HolidayScene

This is a winter scene created for the graphics class at AIT-Budapest. The project uses GLSL, JavaScript, and the WebGLMath library created by Prof. László Szécsi. Much of the code (aside from Scene.js and the shaders) is from Prof. Szécsi's existing JavaScript reflection codebase.

To run:
Download WebGLMath and place it outside of the directory.
Open index.html in Chrome, or another browser that supports WebGL.
